1. Image process to pixelated
2. Image process of all characters
3. Go through each pixel in pixelated by passing in the segmented/subset of image
4. Each pixel gets compared to each character and produce a value from 0 to 1.
    - All different types of comparators
5. Pick the highest with the similiarity
    - Find the highest compare score during the compare procedure
    - Sort after finding all compare scores
        - Might be able to do something with this later. Like also figure out how it matches with the surronding squares
6. Pick character for each pixel
7. Draw image with said pixel
